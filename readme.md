# Introduction

This is a backup site of the great https://eqr.wheretogo.in.th.

This website let you generate PTTEV Station's QR code for a specific charger socket. You need to input a combination of charger ID and a socket number. You can find charger ID using PTT's EVStationPluZ app.

# The Why

QR code sticker on some chargers may be unusable and the one on the charger's screen may not be readable as well. The folks at eqr.wheretogo.in.th did a great job by allow us to generate the needed QR code. They even provide the source code of the site to allow us to use it locally. So, as a backup, I create this website, which will be hosted on Cloudflare pages as a backup. Just in case anything goes wrong with the original one.
