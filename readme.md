# Introduction

This is a backup site of the great https://eqr.wheretogo.in.th.

This website let you generate EVStationPluZ QR code for a specific charger socket. You need to input a combination of charger ID and a socket number. You can find charger ID/socket number using EVStationPluZ app. For DC fast charging, the socket number usually number 2 (the middle one) and 3 (the right one).

# The Why

QR code sticker on some chargers may be unusable/destroyed and the one on the charger's screen may not be readable as well. The folks at https://eqr.wheretogo.in.th did a great job by allow us to generate the needed QR code. They even provide the source code of the site to allow us to use it locally.

I also travel occassionally, using my EV and encounter the problem from time to time. The site serve us well. So well that I think it need backup. So, using the source code provided, I've created an identical site at https://eqr.pages.dev. Just in case anything goes wrong with the original one. I hope the auther won't mind I'm doing this, otherwise please let me know and I will take it down.
